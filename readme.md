# Plant Management System

## Features

## File Formats

The Plant Management System uses a simple text-based file format to store plant data. Each line in the file represents a single plant, with fields separated by a delimiter. The default delimiter is a tab character (`\t`).

The fields for each plant are as follows:

1. Plant Name
2. Notes
3. Watering Frequency (in days)
4. Last Watering Date (in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`)
5. Planting Date (in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`)
